# Xerberus Nodes 

Our Risk Ratings effectively guide investors, but the Risk Rating computation is centralized. This trust-based arrangement gives us the power to alter scores at will, which is unacceptable. 
</br>
</br>
We propose to decentralize and scale up the computation of the Xerberus Risk Ratings through a Network of Nodes, removing Xerberus Servers as centralized power and potential censor.</br>
